    "In this Airbnb price prediction project, I haven chosen to use the data of Vancouver Airbnb from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). I have also build a interactive dashboard so that viewers can have a better understanding about the data.\n",

    "I undertook a comprehensive workflow that included exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, feature selection, hyperparameter optimization, and model testing. Our aim was to develop an effective machine learning model to predict Airbnb prices. The models considered in the project include Polynomial Ridge, LGBM, Random Forest, and variations of Random Forest models. \n",

    "Noteworthy findings include the LGBM model demonstrating a mean test score of 0.6, suggesting promising predictive capabilities. Feature importance analysis and model interpretation were facilitated using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), providing insights into the contribution of different features to model predictions."

The feature importance analysis highlighted key factors influencing predicted prices, with room availability and minimum nights emerging as top contributors. Notably, our innovative feature, capturing the positivity of the description text, secured a position among the top 5 influential features. These findings underscore the model's ability to discern crucial patterns in Airbnb pricing, providing a solid foundation for further refinement and application. Moving forward, ongoing exploration of feature engineering and fine-tuning holds the potential for even more accurate predictions.\n"

The forecasted price, standing at 67.785 (inverse log of 4.231), positions itself below the average. The accompanying waterfall graph unveils the driving factors behind this prediction. This Airbnb listing accommodates 1.248 fewer people and mandates an additional 0.451 minimum nights.
